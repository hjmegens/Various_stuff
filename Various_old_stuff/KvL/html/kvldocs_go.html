<H3 CLASS="western">Search Option: Gene Ontology (GO)</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This option allows you to retrieve all
the genes associated with a GO term or GO id of choice. The input,
i.e. term or id, need to be exact matches.  In case a term is
submitted that has no exact matches an attempt is made to provide
suggestions, but this feature is currently not very effective. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	When a valid term (or id) is provided,
all the genes that are associated <B>with it or its child terms</B>
are retrieved. A list of child terms will be provided, as will be a
list of parent terms for reference. All parent-child relationships
are retrieved from a local database that is based directly on the 
<A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology database</A>.
Associations are based solely on human since this species has the
best GO annotation, and species specific genes are subsequently
obtained by orthologous relationships (EnsEMBL compara). GO
annotations are from a local databased but were mined from NCBI, that
in turn retrieves this information from the <A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene
Ontology database</A>. Local databases are updated twice a year.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What to expect:</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let's assume you have entered a valid
GO term or id.</P>
